- **__Data science:__ Data science is a concept used to tackle big data and includes data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. __Machine learning:__ Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. __Data Analytics:__ Data analysts extract meaningful insights from various data sources. A data scientist creates questions, while a data analyst finds answers to the existing set of questions.
**Today, I am learning Data science from very beginning. I have read and implemented libraries NumPy and Pandas used for data analysis in Python.
**NumPy library can perform verious operations like adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
**pandas library can perform data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.
