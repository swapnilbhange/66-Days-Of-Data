- __Data science:__ Data science is a concept used to tackle big data and includes data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. __Machine learning:__ Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. __Data Analytics:__ Data analysts extract meaningful insights from various data sources. A data scientist creates questions, while a data analyst finds answers to the existing set of questions.
Today, I am learning Data science from very beginning. I have read and implemented libraries basics of NumPy and Pandas used for data analysis in Python.
NumPy library can perform verious operations like adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
pandas library can perform data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

**Day2 of 66DaysOfData!**

- Today I've completed the [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) course from Kaggle.com and got hands-on experience on "Creating, Reading and Writing Indexing", "Selecting & Assigning", "Summary Functions and Maps", "Grouping and Sorting", "Data Types and Missing Values", "Renaming and Combining".
