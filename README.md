- __Data science:__ Data science is a concept used to tackle big data and includes data cleansing, preparation, and analysis. __Machine learning:__ Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. __Data Analytics:__ Data analysts extract meaningful insights from various data sources. A data scientist creates questions, while a data analyst finds answers to the existing set of questions.
Today, I am learning Data science from very beginning. I have read and implemented libraries basics of NumPy and Pandas used for data analysis in Python.
NumPy library can perform verious operations like adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
pandas library can perform data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

**Day 02 of 66DaysOfData!**

- Today I've completed the [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) course from Kaggle.com and got hands-on experience on "Creating, Reading and Writing Indexing", "Selecting & Assigning", "Summary Functions and Maps", "Grouping and Sorting", "Data Types and Missing Values", "Renaming and Combining".
- Here are links to my notebooks:
  1. [Pandas Exercise 1](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilbhange/pandas-exercise-1-creating-reading-and-writing)
  2. [Pandas Exercise 2](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilbhange/pandas-exercise-2-indexing-selecting-assigning)
  3. [Pandas Exercise 3](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilbhange/pandas-exercise-3-summary-functions-and-maps)
  4. [Pandas Exercise 4](https://www.kaggle.com/swapnilbhange/pandas-exercise-4-grouping-and-sorting)

**Day 03 of 66DaysOfData!**
- Today I've Started learning about the Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. Data structures are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and worked with efficiently. They define the relationship between the data, and the operations that can be performed on the data. First I started reading from [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) and then from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-structures-python). From those documentation I was able to understand "Primitive Data Structures" like Integers, Float, Strings, Boolean And "Non-Primitive Data Structures" Arrays, Lists, Tuples, Dictionary, Sets, Files.
- After reading documnetation I started to watch this amazing playlist on [Data Structures And Algorithms](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu_n_a__MI_KktGTLYopZ12) In Python by CodeBasics on Youtube.
